                  A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong
                  cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of
                  assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central
                  banking systems.
                  
                  The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain,
                  that serves as a public financial transaction database.
                  
                  Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized
                  cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other
                  cryptocurrencies) have been created.

                  In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called
                  ecash.Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early form of cryptographic electronic payments
                  which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can
                  be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any
                  third party.
                  
                  In 1996, the NSA published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash,
                  describing a Cryptocurrency system first publishing it in a MIT mailing list and later in 1997, in The American Law
                  Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).
                  
                  In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash
                  system.Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would
                  follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic
                  currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put
                  together and published. A currency system based on a reusable proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed
                  the work of Dai and Szabo.
                  
                  The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used
                  SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an
                  attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October
                  2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of
                  SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.
                  
                  On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role,
                  if any, they can play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.

                    The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of
                    records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash
                    pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently
                    resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two
                    parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is
                    typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once
                    recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks,
                    which requires collusion of the network majority.
                    
                    Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault
                    tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain. Blockchains solve the
                    double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server, assuming no 51% attack (that has
                    worked against several cryptocurrencies).

                        Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single

                        Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a
                        blockchain. Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and
                        started in 2009 when its source code was released as open-source software. 1 Bitcoins are created as a reward
                        for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced
                        by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency
                        wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
                        
                        Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, its high electricity consumption, price volatility, and
                        thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative
                        bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts
                        about bitcoin.

                        Ethereum is an open source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart
                        contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state
                        transitions. Ether is a cryptocurrency generated by the Ethereum platform and used to compensate mining nodes for
                        computations performed. Each Ethereum account has an ether balance and ether may be transferred from one account to
                        another.
                        
                        Ethereum provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using
                        an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's instruction set, in contrast to others like Bitcoin
                        Script, is Turing-complete. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate
                        resources on the network.
                        
                        Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was
                        funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014. The system then went live on 30 July
                        2015, with 72 million coins "premined". This accounts for about 68 percent of the total circulating supply in
                        2019.
                        
                        In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in The DAO project's smart contract software, and subsequent theft of
                        $50 million worth of ether,[6] Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became
                        Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed, and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).

                        A cryptocurrency wallet stores the public and private "keys" or "addresses" which can be used to receive or spend the
                        cryptocurrency. With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated
                        cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.
