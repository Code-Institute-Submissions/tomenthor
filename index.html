                        A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of
                        exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of
                        additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control
                        as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. The decentralized
                        control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a
                        blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. Bitcoin, first released as
                        open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency.
                        Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other
                        cryptocurrencies) have been created.

                        In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic
                        money called ecash.Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early form of
                        cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a
                        bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed
                        the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.
                        In 1996, the NSA published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous
                        Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system first publishing it in a MIT mailing list
                        and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4). In 1998, Wei Dai published a
                        description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash
                        system.Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
                        that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold)
                        was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work
                        function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system
                        based on a reusable proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai
                        and Szabo. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous
                        developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work
                        scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which
                        would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was
                        released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead
                        of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a
                        proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid. On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been
                        commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK
                        economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.

                        The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a
                        continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using
                        cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a
                        timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification
                        of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
                        efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a
                        blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol
                        for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
                        retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the
                        network majority. Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing
                        system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved
                        with a blockchain. Blockchains solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted
                        authority or central server, assuming no 51% attack (that has worked against several
                        cryptocurrencies).

                        without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through
                        cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was
                        invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and
                        started in 2009 when its source code was released as open-source software. 1 Bitcoins are
                        created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies,
                        products, and services. Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017,
                        there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using
                        bitcoin. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, its high electricity
                        consumption, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several
                        Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an
                        investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.

                        Ethereum is an open source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and
                        operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified
                        version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions. Ether is a cryptocurrency
                        generated by the Ethereum platform and used to compensate mining nodes for computations
                        performed. Each Ethereum account has an ether balance and ether may be transferred from one
                        account to another. Ethereum provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual
                        Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The
                        virtual machine's instruction set, in contrast to others like Bitcoin Script, is
                        Turing-complete. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and
                        allocate resources on the network. Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a
                        cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that
                        took place between July and August 2014. The system then went live on 30 July 2015, with 72
                        million coins "premined". This accounts for about 68 percent of the total circulating supply in
                        2019. In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in The DAO project's smart contract
                        software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of ether,[6] Ethereum was split into two
                        separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,
                        and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).

                        for others to send currency to the wallet.
